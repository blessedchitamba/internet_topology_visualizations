"""
-Go through each document, check if the IP attribute has a corresponding setNumber (the host IP router)
-If set number exists, take the IP and setNumber (null if it doesnâ€™t) and add them to an adjacency list db as a single starting vertex instance. 
 In the Tracert array, add the first entry to the adjacency list as a connection
-Iterate through the document's Tracert array and for every other traceroute instance create an adjacency list for it and add the next instance. 
 First check though if no adjacency list has been made already for that set number. Use an array that will indicate 0 or 1 depending on whether 
 that set has a list or not.
-Do the same for every document
-Write the adj list in a csv file
